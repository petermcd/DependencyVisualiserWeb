## Dependency Visualiser Web

This ia very early stage demo of an output driver for
my [Dependency Visualiser](https://github.com/petermcd/Dependency-Visualiser)
project. This currently utilises a driver for Neo4J and accompanies the
[Neo4J storage driver](https://github.com/petermcd/DependencyVisualiserNeo4j).

This project is far from finished and contains some known bugs.
